Networking Fundamentals
OSI Model Layers
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework used to understand how data moves across a network.

Layer 3: Network Layer
Purpose: Responsible for packet forwarding and routing.

Key Function: It determines the best physical path for data to reach its destination based on IP addresses.

Main Protocols: IPv4, IPv6, ICMP.

Device: Routers.

Data Unit: Packets.

Layer 4: Transport Layer
Purpose: Ensures reliable data transfer and flow control.

Key Function: It manages end-to-end communication, error recovery, and segmentation of data.

Main Protocols: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).

Data Unit: Segments (TCP) or Datagrams (UDP).
Practical Tools used in this module
ping: Check connectivity (Layer 3 - ICMP).

traceroute: Map the path to a destination.

netstat / ss: Monitor active connections (Layer 4).
